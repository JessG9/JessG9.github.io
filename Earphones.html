  <h2>Headphone</h2>
  <p>Product Design completed for my technology communications class. This poster as well as all the designs were part of the final project required for students to create some sort of product design that would solve a issue. In my case, I went into product design to design a headphone pertaining to motion sickness. There is also a booklet (pdf below) that was created to complement  the product design. Hierarchy of type and page layout design concepts were applied to create a clean and flawless appeal to the presentation booklet.</p>
